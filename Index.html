                <h2>The Multiverse & You (& You & You & You…)</h2>
                Known as <mark>"Mad Max"</mark> for his unorthodox ideas and passion for adventure, Max Tegmark’s scientific interests range from precision cosmology to the ultimate nature of reality, all explored in his new popular book Our Mathematical Universe. Tegmark is a professor of physics who has published more than two hundred technical papers and been featured in dozens of science documentaries. His work with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on galaxy clustering shared the first prize in Science magazine’s “Breakthrough of the Year: 2003.” For more information about his work, please visit his MIT website and the Future of Life Institute.
                <br />

                Welcome to the Waking Up podcast. This is Sam Harris. Today I’ll be speaking with Max Tegmark. Max is a physicist at MIT, and a cosmologist, in particular. He’s published over 200 technical papers, and he’s been featured in dozens of science documentaries. He’s now an increasingly influential voice on the topic of artificial intelligence, because his Future of Life Institute deals with this and other potential existential threats.
                <br />
                Max has written one book for the general reader which I found incredibly valuable, entitled Our Mathematical Universe. We’ll be talking about some of that today. I really enjoyed speaking with Max. We discussed the foundations of science and what distinguishes science from non-science. We talked about the mysterious utility of mathematics in the natural sciences.
                <br />
                We also talked, for quite some time, about our current picture of the universe from a cosmological perspective, which opens onto the fascinating and totally counterintuitive concept of the multiverse—which, as you’ll see, entails the claim that there may well be a functionally infinite number of people just like yourself leading nearly identical lives and every other possible life at this moment elsewhere in the universe. This is my candidate for the strangest idea that is still scientifically plausible.
                <br />
                And finally, we talked about the dangers of advances in artificial intelligence. In any case, Max is a fascinating guy, and I hope you enjoy our conversation. I also hope you’ll buy his book, because it is well worth reading. And now I give you Max Tegmark…
                <br /><br />
                <strong>SH:</strong> How are you doing, Max? Thanks for coming on the podcast.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>MT:</strong> Thank you for having me. It’s great to be on.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>SH:</strong> It’s really a pleasure to talk to you. I have a lot I want to talk about, including your book, Our Mathematical Universe, which I highly recommend to our listeners. I’m going to talk about some of what I find most interesting in that book, but it by no means exhausts the contents.
                <br /><br />
                I really consider your book a huge achievement. You’ve managed to make an up-to-the-minute picture of the state of physics—and cosmology, in particular—truly accessible to a general reader. That’s certainly not something that all your colleagues can claim to have achieved. So congratulations on that.
                <br /><br />
